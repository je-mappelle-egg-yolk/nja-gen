The current development aim for njaGen is to support more assets from Phantasy Star Online, mostly player models and enemies.

The next features to be added into njaGen are:
-- Modified triangle stripping algorithm
-- NJA compiler update
-- Convert OBJ with quads
-- Levels option for strip optimization
-- Diffuse color for NJA model

The below features are also planned, although it is unlikely they will be included soon:
-- Flat shaded OBJ to smooth shaded OBJ on NJA compilation
-- Custom NJ node format to drop ExMLDNet dependency
-- Custom scripting language for skeletal meshes
-- Convert multiple OBJ into NJ
-- Include models from other SEGA games that use NJ

This feature list is subject to change depending on how far research goes.
