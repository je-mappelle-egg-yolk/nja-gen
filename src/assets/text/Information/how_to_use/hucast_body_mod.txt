Modding HUcasts body requires generation of two seperate NJA models, both of which need to be externally converted to NJ (see "Making use of NJA/NJ").

1. An NJ file with a default evalflag (default setting for this tool), which is imported into "plZsmpnj.afs" using an AFS manager. The files that need to be replaced in "plZsmpnj.afs" are:
--File 33, 39, 45, 51, 57, 63, and 69.

The above files for "plZsmpnj.afs" are morph targets for resizing the character, although it's recommended to use the same model in all slots.

2. An NJ with an alternative evalflag, which replaces "plCbdy00.nj" from the main data folder.

Neither of these NJ files need to be compressed to PRS.

There are some bugs that come with this mod, such as no cloth blending, therefore it's recommended to design alternative solutions to body joints.

Changing the HUcast model in the Dressing Room is a seperate which cannot be done yet.
