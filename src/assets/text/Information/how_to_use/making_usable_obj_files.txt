Since njaGen is in early development there are still some requirements for generating working NJA files, most of these requirements can be applied on model export from a 3D editor. It's expected these requirements will become less restraining as development continues.

1. The OBJ must be triangulated
2. The UV coords of the OBJ shouldn't exceed 256x256
3. The normals exported with the OBJ must be smooth shaded
4. The OBJ cannot have smoothing groups
5. The OBJ cannot contain groups (single mesh only)
6. The OBJ cannot include material information
